    <div class="level-item" data-name="Tape 001" data-id="106305571" data-message="<p>“Tape 001” is an effect level by Sh4dowsn4IL. As the level begins I noticed the camera isn’t perfectly centered onto the edges you have created, I would recommend this small issue could be fixed pretty easily. In terms of block designs throughout the entire level they are quite simple mostly contained by one basic white block. This goes to show how heavily the 2.2 effects are carrying this level. More details inside of he block designs would be a great idea in terms of anything and possibly some more colors and pulses. In terms of the main piece of this level, the effects, some of them get repetitive pretty instantly and some changes to the effects used could be found appropriate, especially with those lines moving forwards and backwards the entire level. Another thing I don’t see in this level and think would work perfectly is movements. Anything ranging from area effects to just a basic move trigger, these would significantly add depth to your level. In addition air decoration and jump indicators would be a great add on to the level. You really used the effects great in this level just more variety in them and more detailed decoration would be recommended. Overall, this is sick 2.2 effect level it just doesn’t execute the effects perfectly but it can possibly act as a great learning experience for you with the 2.2 triggers/effects, I hope to see more from you in the future!</p>">

    <div class="level-item" data-name="Ratechazo" data-id="105686230" data-message="<p>“Ratechazo” is a modern design level by Elerik98YT. Immediately I would like to point out that in the first section some blocks are able to be clipped through due to the lack of hitboxes. Following the transitions in this level especially that first ball one although the first click the auto the second click is still very hard to do. The designs are also very copy and pasted from both these sections with the only difference being length and width. Maybe trying adding different details to the interior of the block designs and possibly more variations and pulses. The forest background in the next section definitely doesn’t fit the theming of the block designs in general. Following on the next part has the best decoration from my eyes but the portals being invisible and moving into the position of use makes it very hard to read these few clicks due to confusion. The next part is by far the weakest part as the decoration is bare and the readability is low. I would recommend putting the massive black glow pillars in the background not the foreground to make reading this part easier. Lastly my major concern for this level is the 88% gap opening which takes this from a 6 star to at least an 8 star all because of that one memory part. A huge recommendation for you is to turn BG effect off as this can help sometimes but in this level it really doesn’t. Overall, I think this level is pretty cool just needs some polishing and work.</p>">

    <div class="level-item" data-name="Super Probably Dash" data-id="78475713" data-message="<p>”Super Probably Dash” is an Extreme Demon inspired from the Extreme “Super Probably Level”. In terms of the level many of them contain similarities in their gameplay and design. In terms of the design and decoration of Super Probably Dash, some parts are definitely weaker than others feeling very empty and considering the detailing going on here is quite small removing emptiness and adding movements is definitely a strong idea. In terms of the movements they were pretty good when used but some sections lacked the usage of them. This easily can throw the quality of the level off as some parts flourish above others. I am aware this is a 2.1 level and you may not want to use 2.2 features but something you could use to improve movements and, many things in general, in the level are area triggers. I really don’t have an opinion on the gameplay considering it is memory but it definitely looks tough congrats to the verifier. Overall, this is a very sick level and very cool in general.</p>" >

    <div class="level-item" data-name="Lightwork" data-id="106976301" data-message="<p>Right from the get go this level was pretty interesting. The song choice in this level really fit the entire theme/idea of ice. The name is also in great relation to the vibe of the level being very bright. This leads me to instantly point out how the brightness and effects make the gameplay very hard to sightread in the first sections. Here is an image just for reference on how hard it is to read.</p><img src='https://sadwave.cloud/IMG_2862.jpeg'><p>Following on the saws in this section feel really forced into the level just to add some sort of detail that is not in the very nice block designs. The blue orb at 14% is near invisible and would reccomend fixing this. In terms of the area effects I really enjoy them in this level I just would have loved a potential change of effects into the ship section. Anything really, like area scale or fade rather than move. The gameplay during this section is really fun and fair to the player making for a fun level. Going into the ball part I really liked the effects inside the block designs. Although a little bit of possible variety in the block designs would be cool I appreciate the swap in the block design. 
      Following onto probably the weakest part of this level the wave section. Im just going to let this image speak for itself.</p><img src='https://sadwave.cloud/IMG_2863.png'><p>If you cant tell from the image the slopes can hardly even be read whatsoever. This makes this section very unfair to the player and having to hit the blue pads only makes it harder. All of the gameplay following after is fun and enjoyable except for a few clicks after the dual section which could get hard and really based on how you exit the dual. In terms of the decoration it stays really simple and keeps its colors even the slightest change possibly to purple would be very awesome. The level ends off with a pretty sick endscreen with quite cool moving saws. Here are a few things I believe you did good and bad. Good: You really used the area effects in a great way to remove the static feeling to the level. You also made the transitions good by making almost all easy to read or first click auto which is great. You also changed the block design during thr level which is a huge bonus. Bad: The effects used in this level are a bit overused and can distract the player from the gameplay by making it hard to read. The blocks arent fully hitboxed meaning you can go through them in some sections as skips which just feels weird. The choice of colors really adds brightness to the level which can really hurt your eyes and make the level hard to read. Im sorry but sadly I will not be sending this level to moderators but I think it is still an awesome level.</p>" >

  <div class="level-list">
    <div class="level-item" data-name="Celestial Rhythm" data-id="107361434" data-message="<p>As the level begins the first thing I notice is that the glow behind the player is not placed behind the player. On top of this the glow doesn’t work with the duals as it only shows on one player. In terms of gameplay I would like to mention the unbalanced gameplay with some parts being easy and others being hard. On top of this a few parts are hard to read due to stacking of portals. The transition around 50% is also quite hard to read due it being completely blind and if you decide to hold it will lead you to your death which is very unfair to the player.
The decoration in this level is definitely pretty simple and very static. The block designs could definitely use a bit more variety in some sections and more details rather than just a basic block. A few huge recommendations for you would be to first implement more movements into your level but properly. Making sure the movements don’t effect the readability of the gameplay is important. Another tip would be to use multiple colors and use pulses. This level contained basically none of these as it only used 1 color and from what I can see no pulses. Lastly, just putting more detail into the block designs is definitely a key factor just don’t put too much details. Keep it slick and simple not slick and crazy
Here are a few things you did good and a few things you can improve on.
Good things following.
The option to disable the player glow is definitely a good feature as it can get annoying sometimes during wave sections.
The usage of the swing copter gamemode is always interesting as it is a newer vehicle and is quite fun although, I just feel like when it was used it was used in a very difficult way.
The background, this one’s pretty sick but I could definitely see some potential improvements with the changing of it in some sections.
Bad things following. 
Block design is key and as mentioned earlier more details, colors, and pulses would make this way more interesting.
The gameplay while being fun in some sections can get quite hard to read due to blind transitions and stacked portals as said above. In general, while this level is pretty fun, personally I just don’t see this one going for a rate at the moment. For you I would focus on your block design as the background is pretty sick. I would suggest spending some time on YouTube watching block design tutorials to hopefully improve your designs.</p>">
